									<p>In this section, we will provide a summary of our achievements to highlight the parts of the project that we have completed. We will provide a list of known bugs and issues with our application. We will also do a critical evaluation of our project and give some guidance about future work on this application.</p>

                                    <h2>Critical Evaluation of the project</h2>
									<p>We have completed all of our required functionalities, however there are many improvements to be made despite this success. Firstly, we have kept our user interface very simple as we have mainly focused on achieving the functionality goals. This decision was also made because we don't want to have a cluttered User Interface as the interactions with thephone must be subtle and easy to carry out. Despite this, improvements can be made for logs UI as they would not be used during consultations.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>With regards to the glasses, we believe that since the technology is still in early stages, it is better to simply use our mobile application instead. On one hand, using the glasses involves less head movement for the user meaning better focus. On the other hand, the process of setting them up is faulty and not guaranteed to work. The glasses are not a stable and reliable technology yet, but our phone application is stable and works without them. We think that by using an upgraded or renewed model, this issue might be solved, thus making the glasses the most optimal option for our solution. For now, we recommend that the user only employ the mobile phone application for a better user experience.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>As was previously stated, we have fully completed the required project functionality. This means that our system can pick up words and the user can decide to show the definition for a word or pass to the next word. This will be useful in a variety of scenarios bbut suits the client's required use case. We did not finish the optional functionality of learning from the user since we focused on getting the rest of it done. This would be a great addition to the application as it will allow the app to be customised for each user.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Our application was designed to run android mobile phones for compatibility with the glasses. There is currently no development taking place on another platform such as iOS. This could however be a plan for the future as a large amount of people nowadays use iPhones. Our decision to stick with android only was based on time-estimations and compatibility with the glasses. However, we think that it would be very beneficial to have a specific iOS application. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>On this website, we have aimed to provide developers with as much information as possible in order to continue the development of our application. Given that we had not programmend for Android before this project, many sections of the code would most surely be more efficient if rewritten. We have tried our best to make our code legible by adding comments explaining what the different sections do and naming our classes according to the functions they carry out. Additionally, we have provided the API key for the dictionary but future developers could request a new one from Meriam Webster's website.</p>
                                    
                                    <hr class="major" />
                                    <h2>Future Work</h2>
                                    <p>We have already mentioned some of the aspects of our application that could be continued and improved but in this section we would like to give a specific list of things that we think would be the next steps for the application.</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Currently, we use an Arraylist for blacklisted words. A first improvement would be to change this so that the blacklisted words are stored on a file specific to the user and then loaded into the application. The method loadBlacklistedWords() has already been defined so the only change would have to be accessing files.</li>
                                        <li>Following on (1), it would then be quite simple and very useful to add an option for users to add words to the blacklist and/or to make the application automatically add words that are not relevant to the context/user.</li>
                                        <li>We would suggest improving the XML parser so that it returns information in a more dictionary-like format. The details of the XML are available on the API's Documentation page. </li>
                                        <li> Adding an option in the logs for further information on the word rather than only displaying the information would also be a good improvement. As an example, having a link to the wiki page or a specific medical terms information page.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>Aside from the above, there are two other main things that we think our application would be very helpful with in the future. Firstly, we have made it so that the logs are saved in XML format so that the data can easily be exported for analysis. This would be very helpful for research purposes. For examlple, knowing what words turn up the most could help identify gaps in teaching. The second important aspect of our application is that it can be used in many different contexts and is not limited to the patient-gp consultation idea that started it. It could be used in many areass of medicine such as pediatrics or orthopaedics and even be expanded to other domains by changing the dictionary. We believe that our application will not only help professionals within the field of medicine but people from a variety of jobs and backgrounds.</p>
