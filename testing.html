									<p>In this section, we will detail the testing process for our application and its outcome. We will discuss some testing strategies such as system integration and we will also give an overview of all the test cases that we designed to make sure that the app's main functionalities are working.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Performance Testing</h2>
									<p>First of all we acarried out some performance testing using android studio's in-built tool. This allowed us to see if our application was using a certain resource too much. Below is a comparison of our testing from midway through the development process (left) and at the end of development (right).</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Usability Testing</h2>
									<p>Usability testing is useful to carry out when you want to evaluate how a user would use your application. We carried out this testing by observing people using our application. The testers were not given any prior manual for using the application so that they were completely new to the app. We did however briefly explain the goal of the application so that they had a starting point for usage. Tha table below summarises our observations:</p>

                                    <p>Our goal is to make the UI easily navigable and visually appealing whilst keeping it minimal so that the user can focus on what is important. This simplicity we aim for will let them focus on the task at hand rather than being distracted by the application as that would work against our goal of developing an effective learning tool. However, it also can create some confusion which we have tried to solve by making the buttons more descriptive. Additionally, we provide a user's manual that details the various processes and how to use the application.

									<h2>Integration and Regression Testing</h2>
									<p>
                                    As shown in our production timeline, the development of the application was split into major components which would be worked on separately and then brought together once the individual parts have been tested and working. These parts mainly consisted of UI design, creation of the speech recognition service, creation of the medical dictionary lookup and the smart glasses interface and communication to and from the mobile application.</p>
                                    <p>
                                    Initially the basic frame of the application was developed which checked for appropriate navigation between the screens of the application and writing the button interactions. Alongside this the speech recognition was development in a standalone activity. After they were tested, the background activity was then converted to a fragment to suit the style of the UI application structure and re-tested.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    The next step was adding the dictionary lookup part of the application. Since there was no voice input, initially this was completed using and input box where words were simply entered in. The first step of importing this into the main application was converting the activity to a fragment and then testing it in the same way as when it was tested in its standalone app. After confirming the dictionary lookup was still working, the dictionary lookup had to be altered so that it is able to take voice input rather than only an input box. This was initially tested using single key phrases then multiple phrases in succession to then finally being tested with a regular sentence containing a mixture of keywords and regular conversational text.
                                    </p>

                                    
                                    <hr class="major" />
                                    <h2>User Acceptance Testing Suite</h2>
                                    <p>In addition to the above, we have created a test suite containing tests relating to all of our functionality. For example all test cases labaled TC_Logs will be test cases for using the logs. We have aimed to provide an extensive list of test cases that can be used to guide a user through using the application. </p>

                                    <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
                                    <p>We also did some unit tests throughout the development of our application to test specific features. Below are the 2 unit tests that we used to check that the blacklisted words were being added correctly and non-blacklist words were not being added to the list. </p>
